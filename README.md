The Screaming Circuits business card holder is a multi-function device intended for your amusement and as a demonstration of our workmanship.

The current version of the card holder, V2.6, uses a PIC18F46K22 microcontroller. The design will work fine with other members of the PIC18F??K22 family. However, it you change the variant, you will need to uncomment the corresponding #define in globals.h, under the personality settings section.
